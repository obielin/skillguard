skillguard
==========
Security scanner for AI agent skills.
Detects prompt injection, data exfiltration, and malicious payloads
before you install. Zero dependencies.

Inspired by the ClawHavoc campaign (341 malicious skills, Jan 2026)
and Snyk ToxicSkills (13.4% of 3,984 skills contained critical issues).

Quick start:
    from skillguard import SkillScanner

    scanner = SkillScanner()

    # Scan a skill file
    result = scanner.scan_file("SKILL.md")
    print(result.risk_level)    # CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW / SAFE
    print(result.risk_score)    # 0-100
    for finding in result.findings:
        print(finding.rule_id, finding.severity.value, finding.name)

    # Scan a directory of skills
    report = scanner.scan_directory("./skills/")
    print(report.summary())
    print(f"Flag rate: {report.flag_rate:.0%}")

    # Scan text directly
    result = scanner.scan_text(skill_content, name="my_skill")
